!!! warning

    This is a limited public demo of a fraction of some internal research code. Full code is slowly being documented and released.

!!! danger
    
    This is software is still in a fairly unstable alpha state! The documentation is extremely barebones and current users are expected to read the source code.

A good place to start is the How-To pages.
For instance, the [implementation of a first generation repeater](@ref First-Generation-Quantum-Repeater).
